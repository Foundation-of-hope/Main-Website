# Foundation of Hope
## Media Development

Hey Everyone so our goal this week is to improve the entire web experience.

Our first task will be working on the "About Us" 'experience'


Things that we will be using
1. Frameworks
	1. Bootstrap
	2. Pending
2. Tools (Suggestions and not a requirement)
	1. Sublime Text 3 (Text Editor)
	2. GitKrakken (GUI for Git)
3. Pending


The website will have many pages. So we will be dividing these pages up into managable 'chunks'
So every two weeks we will have pick a section to work on (from trello) and everyone will pick a task from that section (Note: You can work with someone else on the same thing if you want to, but will have to communicate this during the meeting). 
After you pick a section, you will have to come up with at least two different approaches to implementing the section you have chosen. And get feedback from it from the Project Owner (Rebecca). After its been approved, you can code it out and then have it reviewed, and eventually it will be published. And then the process will repeat over and over again. 

After each meeting i will update the "checklist" below. Below will find a description of each "state"
- [ ] Indicates that it has not been checked out by someone
- [x] ... It has been checked out by someone (but is still in progress)
- [r] ... It has been finished and needs to be reviewed
- [P] ... Approved and has been published


- [ ] List everyone that has made a commit in the authors section of the package.json
- [x] About Us: History Page (Nishtha)
- [x] About Us: Board of Trustees (UtibeAbasi)
- [x] Home Page: (UtibeAbasi)
- [x] Logos: Need Logo(Rebecca)


How should we approach CSS?
I would like to suggest that we use stylus.

To use it you will need to have Node.js installed and then after cloning this repo, come to this directory within your terminal and then type `npm install` after thats done run `npm run styl`

This will compile all changes made in the style.styl file and will place them in the style.css file.

Note: I've added some code that might help us, with regards to how we should approach coding standards. Check out the style.styl file in addition to _normalize.styl and also _typography.styl
